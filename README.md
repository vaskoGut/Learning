1. ### what is difference between let const var
  **Var** - scope is globar of function ( if var's used inside function ).
  Let, const - they have block scope.
  
  if(true) {
    let test = 'test'; // test variable is available only inside if block
  }

  **Let** - can be reasigned.
  **Const** - can't be reasigned.
