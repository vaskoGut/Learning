1. ### what is difference between let const var
   **Var** - scope is global or function ( if var's used inside function ).
   Let, const - they have block scope.

   ```javascript
     if(true) {
       let test = 'test'; // test variable is available only inside if block
     }
   ```
   **Let** - can be reasigned.
   **Const** - can't be reasigned.
   
1. ### arrow function explanation
   **Functional expression** - function defined inside an expression. Example:

    ```javascript
       const getRectArea = function (width, height) {
        return width * height;
       };
       console.log(getRectArea(3, 4));
   ```
   
   **Functional declaration** - function declared with function keyword. Functional declaration creates binding of new function to a given name.

    ```javascript
       function calcRectArea(width, height) {
          return width * height;
       }
       console.log(calcRectArea(5, 6)););
   ```

      ```javascript
      function print() {
        console.log(arguments)
      }

      print(1,2,3,4);

      /*
        result below:
        {
          "0": 1,
          "1": 2,
          "2": 3,
          "3": 4
        } 
      */
   ```
   Remember arrow function don't have acces to the arguments.

   ```javascript
      const obj = {
      name: 'deeecode',
      print: function() {
        console.log(this)
      }
    }
    obj.print()
   ```
   You can't do smth like above with arrow function.
      
   **Arrow function** - don't have binding to this ( in inherits this from outside look code example below), arguments, super and shouldn't be used as methods.
   They can't be used as a constructors - we can't call them with new keyword. Cannot be used as generator functions.

   Explain next examples:
   ```javascript
     function Person() {
      this.age = 0;
  
      setInterval(() => {
          this.age++; // `this` refers to the `Person` instance
          console.log(this.age); // Correctly logs the incremented age
      }, 1000);
    }

   let p = new Person();
  ```
  ```javascript
    function Person() {
      this.age = 0;
  
      setInterval(function() {
          this.age++; // `this` refers to the global object or `undefined` in strict mode
          console.log(this.age); // NaN or throws error in strict mode
      }, 1000);
    }
    let p = new Person();
  ```

 4. ### Generator function
    **Generator**  is a process that can be paused and resumed and can yield multiple values. Generator returns iterable Geneartor object.
       ```javascript
         function* generator(i) {
            yield i;
            yield i + 10;
            yield i + 20;
          }
          
          const gen = generator(10);
          
          console.log(gen.next().value);
          // Expected output: 10
          
          console.log(gen.next().value);
          // Expected output: 20
          
          console.log(gen.next().value);
          // Expected output: 30

          console.log(gen.next().value);
          // Expected output: undefined
       ```
       Calling .next() returns an object in form:
       ```javascript
         { 
           value // current value of the iterator, 
           done  // boolean indicating if iteration is finished 
         }
       ```
   5. ### types enums interfaces
      1. What are types, when do we use it? 
       **Types** are definitions of data type. Typescript compiler use it to  detect errors.
      2. What are **Tuples**? 
          ```javascript
            let ourTuple: [number, boolean, string];
          ``
      Tuples are typed arrays.
      4. What are **Unions**?
         A union type describes a value that can be one of several types.
          ```javascript
           function printStatusCode(code: string | number) {
              console.log(`My status code is ${code}.`)
            }
          ```
      5. An **intersection type** is a type that merges several kinds into one.
         ```javascript   
          interface Student { 
            student_id: number; 
            name: string; 
          } 
            
          interface Teacher { 
            Teacher_Id: number; 
            teacher_name: string; 
          } 
            
          type intersected_type = Student & Teacher; 
            
          let obj1: intersected_type = { 
            student_id: 3232, 
            name: "rita", 
            Teacher_Id: 7873, 
            teacher_name: "seema", 
          }; 
            
          console.log(obj1.Teacher_Id); 
          console.log(obj1.name)
         ```
      6. What are  enums? When to use?
         **Enums** are collection of constants
      7. Types is used to type your values, to avoid errors and bugs.
      Here more:  https://blog.logrocket.com/typescript-enums-vs-types
      8. Enums example:

      ```javascript
       enum Names {
          Vasyl,
          Yaroslav,
          Igor
        }
        var test = Names.Yaroslav;// 1
     ```
      8. Interface: An interface is used to define a structure for an object.


  5. ### map-foreach-difference
      **Map** return NEW array. It doesn't modify initial array.
      **ForEach** doesn't return array. But runs function for each element of array. Foreach returns original array.
      **Filter, slice** returns new array. They dont mutate initial array.

  7. ### this-meaning

       1. This is keyword. It refers to different objects depending on how and where it used.
       2. You can't change this value.
       3. ALone **this** refers to the global object.  INside function - this refers to the global object also. In event handlers this refers to the hTML object.
        ```javascript
          function dotest() {
              console.log(this); // here we'll get Windows object
          }
        ``` 
       4. Call and apply methods are used to call 1 object method on another object as argument
       6. If yout type this in console, you will get Window object.
    
  8. ### settimeout-async
        Yes setTimeout is async

  9. ### example-promise
        Promise object represents eventual completion or failure of asynchronous function. Whenever tasks should be executed asynchronouslo. Promisess are used.
        Example login function:
        ![image](https://github.com/vaskoGut/Learning/assets/7413864/e627bed4-169b-4366-9de8-2fa87aabbd8c)
        Promise returns fullfilled or rejected status.
        Promise is asyncchronous function.
        Promises can be handled with:

        **then catch**:
        ```javascript
          const doPromise = () => {
              new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                  resolve({result: 5 });
              }).then((data) => console.log(data));
          }
          
          doPromise();
        ```

        ```javascript
          Promise.then(() => datafetch).then(result => result).catch(()=>'error fetching data')
        ```
        **asyn await try catch**
       ```javascript
        async function main() {
          try {
            const doc = await db.doc("user/" + uid).get()
        
            if (doc.exists) {
              console.log("User data:", doc.data());
              // use fetched data, for example in setState()
            } else {
              console.warn("No user data.");
            }
          }
          catch(error) {
            console.log("Error getting user data:", error);
          }
        }
        ```
       Promise all (method) takes an array of promises and returns a single promise. The returned promise fullfills if all promises are executed, and noone fails.
      ```javascript
        const promise1 = Promise.resolve(3);
        const promise2 = 42;
        const promise3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'foo');
        });
        
        Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3]).then((values) => {
          console.log(values);
        });
       ```

  10. ### closure-explanation
        1. If we speak about closure , we need to mention **local** and **global** scope. Functions have its local, private scope. Variables can be global or private - depending where they'are declared.
        2. if variable is declared without keyword, it is global. Even if it's declared inside the function.

        ```javascript
          function doTest() {
            test = 5;
          }
          doTest();
          console.log(test); // 5
        ```
    
 11. ### rest-spread-operator-difference
      1. You can use spread operator to merge 2 objects,or 2 arrays. In React you can use spread operator to pass properties to the component:
          ```javascript
           const props = {firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe'};
            const component = <UserComponent {...props} />;
          ```

          **rest** operator can be used to extract the remaining properties.
          ```javascript
             const {a, ...rest} = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
            console.log(rest); // {b: 2, c: 3}
          ```

   12. ### set-object
      1. Set object allows you to store any unique value:
     
          ```javascript
             const a = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
          ```
    
    Set Object provides:
    A size property that contains a number.
    A has() method that takes an element and returns a boolean.
    A keys() method that returns an iterator of the elements in the set.
          
  12. ### try-catch
      Wraps code that can fail and pass errortothe catch instead of crashing the app.
  
  13. ### type-interface-diff
      Types in TypeScript are more flexible and can define primitive, intersection, union, tuple, or different types of data, while interfaces are used to describe the shape of an object

  14. ### collection-js-array
      Eather
       ```javascript
      const arrray = [...yourObjectCollection];
      // Or make it with Array.from
       Array.from(yourObjectCollection)
       ```

   15. ### stringify-3rd-parametes
     it adds additional spacing

   16. ### try-catch-finally
     ```javascript
       try {
          // try_statements
       } catch(error) {
        // catch_statements  
      }
      finally() {
        // codes that gets executed anyway
      }
    ```

  17. ### arrow-function

    This inside arrow function is referenced, pointed to the global object. We normal function declaration - it points to the inner scope.

  18. ### object-assign

    Object assign method is used to clone or copy proeperties from 1 object to another.
    const obj = { a: 1 };
    const copy = Object.assign({}, obj);
    console.log(copy); // { a: 1 }

    You can add 1 target object, and 2 source objects like that:
    
    Object.assign({}, product, {
      votes: product.votes + 1,
    });

   19. ### object-create
       
      With help of Object.create we can create an object from a given prototype object. It retrns a new object with the prototype set to given object. 

      ```javascript
        const myPrototype = {
          size: 'large',
          getSize() {
            return this.size;
          }
        };


        const myObject = Object.create(myPrototype);
        console.log(myObject.getSize()); // 'large'
      ```

      It can also be used Object.create to create subobject, which inherits properties and methods from their parent objects.

       ```javascript
            const mySubObject = Object.create(myObject, { 
            color: { value: 'red' } 
        });
      ```
      console.log(mySubObject.getSize()); // 'large' 
      console.log(mySubObject.color); // 'red'

# Exercises Javascript Typescript
1. ### for-each-result-exercise

    ```javascript
       const names = ["Rohit","Aakash","Vinay","Ashish","Vasu"];
       const tes = names.forEach((item) => item + 'lolo');
    ```

    Answer: it will be undefined, cause forEach doesn't return any walue, it just runs function for each element of array

2. ### split-string-exercise
   ```javascript
     var s = 'john smith~123 Street~Apt 4~New York~NY~12345';
     s.split('~')
    ``
3. ### previous-state-example
    Count example (to get previous state we need to put callback function):
    ![image](https://github.com/vaskoGut/Learning/assets/7413864/5d05d3e0-9ac9-4032-a425-940e49c9b27d)

4. ### spread-object-kay-value
    ```javascript
    const test = { test: 'test '};
    {...test, name: 'pame'}

5. ### infinite-rendering
    ![image](https://github.com/vaskoGut/Learning/assets/7413864/b5fd215f-ac97-422d-9f8e-0dc9b8a19805)
    Answer -setCounter should be used out of useEffect here to prevent infinite rendering problem.

1. ### What is react
   **React** - is library. Main React features:
   1. JSX - js extension. We can write HTML structures inside JS. For example use HTML structures inside if structure:
   ![image](https://github.com/vaskoGut/Learning/assets/7413864/7c2ec527-a760-46bf-ae67-a8d2e10d6f4b)


   2. Components - we create reusable, independent components.
   3. Virtual DOM - it's virtual copy of DOM, with help of it preformance is improved. With help of that we update only necessary things in DOM, not rebuilding all DOM tree.
   4. One way data-binding.
   5. high performance - while updating components - we don't refresh, update all application.
      
   ______________

2. ### What is unindirectional data flow
   Children component're placed inside parent component. Data's transfered from parent component to child component. Benefits unindirectional data-flow:
       1. Easy to debug - cause we know how and frome where data is coming.
       2. Less errors - more control on data.
   ______________

3. ### What is state in react
   State in React - is object containing component an information. It can be changed. When state's changed, component is rerendered.
   Remember not to mutate directly React's state, cause it can lead to different problems, bugs
   ______________

5. ### Can browser read jsx
   Nope, it's used babel to transpile jsx code to regular JS.
   ______________
   
6. ### what is dom
   **Document Object Model** - is interface that treats HTML as a tree structure, in which each node is object representing a part of the document. DOM defines a way nodes are accessed and manipulated.
   ![image](https://github.com/vaskoGut/Learning/assets/7413864/6c69442b-2d90-40a8-898d-f3e9d695c19a)
   **Virtual DOM** - it's virtual copy of DOM, with help of it preformance is improved. With help of that we update only necessary things in DOM, not rebuilding all DOM tree.  
   React **Reconciliation** process of updating DOM. It updates the virtual DOM first and then uses the diffing algorithm to make efficient and optimized updates in the Real DOM.
   ______________
7. ### difference between es6 es6
   - es6 ins newest version of js
   - es6 has additional type Symbol
   - es6 has 2 new ways of declaring variables: let and const
   - es6 has arrow function
   - little bit difference while importing, exporting components, declaring classes
   ______________
 8. ### basic react app
    Install node, instal crea-react-app. It's ready to use.
    ______________
 9. ###  what is event in react
     Event in React is action triggered on some change in the user interface. It can be click or key pressing for example.
     **Synthetic event** - synthetic event is object we get after triggering some event. An example:

   ```javascript
      <button onClick={e => {
        console.log(e); // React event object
      }} />
   ```
 9. ###  lists-in-react
     List is created with help of map method.
     ![image](https://github.com/vaskoGut/Learning/assets/7413864/9b735b91-5d29-48cd-80b0-ec723397786f)

 10. ###  keys in react lists
     1. Key is a unique identifier and it is used to identify whhich element of list was updated, deleted or added. Keys also help to improve performance of rendering lists.
     2. Index should be added as index cause, if you for example filter  your list - elements of list will get new indexes - other than you initialized  at first.

 12. ###  commponents in react
     React application consists of react component. Component is a reausable piece of code. Component can be stateless or statefull.

 13. ###  state in react
     You needed constructor and set value to the this.state. Now you can just use useState hook.

 14. ###  props in react
     Props are short for properties. In React it's object, storing value of attributes, smth. like html attributes. We need it to pass data from component to the component.
     Inside component we have an access to props in similar way as we have an access to the function parameters.

 15. ###  state props difference
     State is muttable. Props are unmutable. State refers to internal data of component. Props are date transfered from parent component to the child.

 16. ###  high-ordered-component
     High ordered component is wrapper for other components. They allow to reuse some logic across different components. 
     F.e. you want to add logger HOC, which will be loging information about mounting, demounting component. 
      export default withLogger(SomeComponent);

 17. ###  use-effect-lifecycle-methods
    What are standart lifecycle React methods?
    **getInitialState()**, **componentDidMount()**, **shouldComponentUpdate()**, **componentDidUpdate()**, **componentWillUnmount()**

 17. ###  use-memo
    UseMemo() hook helps to cache, remember the result of calculations between rereners.

     // trivial example of using useMemo

      ```javascript
        const sortedNames = useMemo(() => {
         [...someValue].sort();
        }, [names]);
      ```
      
     ```

    // if we wanna have different value of method, depending on url value:
     ```javascript
        const method = useMemo(() => {
           method: "Post",
           url
        }, [url]);
      ```
  18. ###  controlled-uncontrolled-componenent
  We used **controlled** or **uncontrolled** components inside form ( while dealing with inputs ).
  If we have input connected to the state, and handle that value. It's controlled component. Displayed data is syncronized with the state of component.
  ![image](https://github.com/vaskoGut/Learning/assets/7413864/58c5e8a2-5102-4f45-a6c9-8b5ba7ce6ca7)

  **Uncontrolled** components hold their state internally. And you query DOM using a ref to find its current value when you need it.

  19. ###  react-hooks
  Hooks was added in React 16.8 to allow  function components to have access to state and other React features.
  Bad practices: - dont dynamically mutate a hook, dont dynamically use hook. Example: don't push hook as prop.

  20. ###   use-effect-hook
      1.  **UseEffect** allows to perform you side effects in your application ( fetchingdata, diretly update dom, setting timers).
      2. useEffect is called after first render, and every time component is updated.
      3. Difference between useEffect and UseLayoutEffect ( Useeffect runs after browser finishing painting,useLayoutEffect runs synchronically with painting browser). 
      UseEffect  has built-in error handling, so it doesn't crush entire application,whiel  useLayoutEffect
      doesn't have it.

  21. ###   use-callback
      If you need call function, but don't want it toretriggered in useEffect, then you will need useCallback.
      If we want to pass some function, to the component, and we don't want that component to be rerendered.
      Then can use useCallback. Example:
      ![image](https://github.com/vaskoGut/Learning/assets/7413864/b131c944-ff04-4800-8e52-c9e9fbde5161)
      

  23. ###   use-ref
       1. UseREf is hook, which we need if we want to operate directly with DOM.
       2. Example of use: if we need for example some input in form to be auto  focused. We need to find that element in DOM and autofocus.
       3. UseReff return object with current property.
          ```javascript
            const refValue = useRef(0); // this will return { current: 0 } object.
          ```
       UseRef example:
       ![image](https://github.com/vaskoGut/Learning/assets/7413864/51454d23-3adb-4503-aabd-a5fdd38c19af)

  23. ###    use-state-use-ref-diff
      With help of both you can save some value.
      Whatever you store in useRef is not reactive, it means it will not cause component rerender.

  24. ###  react-context
      React context is alternative to the 'prop drilling' ( passing data from parent to children ). Context is often consideredas  lighter, simpler solution to using Redux for state management.
      With context API we have 1 store where all data is passed to and from all data is extracted from.
      Example of data stored in context: template language, user authentificated data. ANother good example is dark mode - if you want an access to it from each component.
  
  25. ###  react-structuring-code
       You need specific folder for your components ( it can be also seperate folder for your common components ), for hooks, constants. 
       It's good to have proper structure - it's easier to find what you need, it's easier to make onboarding for new team members.
       It's god to use absoolute imports.

  26. ###  react-test-how-work
        1. YOu can use e2e tests ( when you test your whole applications ( all components connected 1 to another) on real scenarious, data ). You can also make unit tests ( when you testing behaviour of each component)
        2. We use react-test-library. You operate on real DOM, while using this library. You can  find element by role or by data-testid. It can be also simulated events with help of that library.

  27. ###  react-dev-tools   
      React dev tools is extension, it can be installed for any browser. As rule we use it if we have some problem with performance ( for example component is rendered too many times ).

  28. ###  react-portals

      1. React portals let you render some component outside your normal react component structure.
      2. Example: you can use it for creating modals.
      3. portal will not inherit parent css styles. Remember using stopPropagation() - event emmited from a portal component - will propagate to the Reactt tree and trigger event on  ancestor component.
      Example createPortal:
  ![image](https://github.com/vaskoGut/Learning/assets/7413864/a4673b20-a45a-45cc-84be-ced9a5c92691)

   29. ###  code-splitting
         1. Splitting code is technique which allows to optimize the performance of React application.  With help of it you can split your code into smaller chunks and loading the on-deman.
         You can reduce load time. React provides built-in tools. Like lazy, suspend.
  
         ```javascript
           const SomeComponent = React.lazy(() => import('~/components/SomeComponnent')
          ```
         2. SUspense let you load fallback, while yoru children components are loading.

   30. ###  ssr-csr
         1. **SSR** -  Server side rendering. **CSR** - CLient side rendering.
         2. Gatsby.js and Next.js supports both CSR and SSR.
         3. Static Pages are built during build time. SSR allow to render a page during run-time. You can deal with data  that is fetched when a user visits the page.
         4. 1 of the most importa benefits oF SSR can be improving performance of your website. You can reduce the amount of work the users's browser needs to do.
         5. Practical example: you need to call some script and add smth to the header only after some behaviour user on page.  In gatsby.js pages are rendered statically during build, to do smth like that you need SSR.


   31. ###  fragment-explanation
          **Fragment** alows you to return group ofchildren elments without need of extra DOM component.

   32. ###  use-effect-empty-array
          Your effect will run only after initial render.

   33. ###  example-hook
        **Hooks** are reusable functions. Example: hook for fetching data, or another example hook for recognition screen size.
       ![image](https://github.com/vaskoGut/Learning/assets/7413864/c895a2bf-3b3d-4ac1-9922-589c079f583a)

   33. ###  event-listener
        **Hooks** are reusable functions. Example: hook for fetching data, or another example hook for recognition screen size.
        ![image](https://github.com/vaskoGut/Learning/assets/7413864/6a2f472f-eb8f-4c6a-8237-0ed27deb947b)

   
   35. ### #too-many-useeffect-explain
        ![image](https://github.com/vaskoGut/Learning/assets/7413864/b2924d25-2088-4928-b941-4c79820fa729)
        solution: it's better to drop it in 1 useEffect and handle different cases. Or you can drop it in distinct function.




  ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


 
  1. ### Monorepo and polyrepo difference
  **Monorepo** - its one repo, containing multiple applications, projects with well defined, structured relationships.
  
   **Polyrepo** - a repo for each team, application, project. It's often has a single build artifact, and simple build pipeline.
   Build artifact - files produced by build ( different logs, reports, distribution pacakgs ).

    1. Is **Monolith** same as monorepo? No, monolith itj just repository containing a application, but there is no well prepared dependencies, it's not wel structured and encapsulated.
    2. What is advantage of **polyrepo**? With help of it we can keep team autonomy. You can decide what you do with your repo, who can have access for it, when to deploy it etc.
    3. What is disadvantages of **polyrepo**? 
    - problem when you want to share code betweend different repos;
    - problems with compability of third party libraries;
    - time consuming configuration of each repo and synchronizing it.
    - if each team works only on 1 repo, code can be repeated etc;
    - if we have some share repo, library and you need to make change, it should be tested change for reach repo.
    - each repo can have different settings tools
    - it can be problem to use projects like that.
    4.What are advantages of **monorepo**? 
    - easy to create new project;
    - it's easy to test your change for different packages or applications.
    - it's better developer mobility and performance while working on monorepoy
    - all projects inside monorepo using same versions of thirls party libraries;
    - atomic commits - you dont need different projects, apps dependency after each commit, change

 2. ### what is webhooks
  **Webhooks** - automated messages sent from apps when something (event) happens. Example payPal sends you notification, when some of clients payed you some money. OR when some ecomerce shops notify you when you have some new order.
  It's a way one app push automatically notifications to other app.
  - what is difference between webhook and API? To put it simply - API does stuff when you ask it to. Webhooks does it when some situation, event is triggered. We can say it works on its own.
 ______________
 3. ### what is babel


    1. Babel is transpiler, with help of it developers can use newest features of language.
    2. Babel configuration. You need node.js, npm. Later create configuration file, babelrc. NExt install plugins, presets. And finally creating build script.
    3. Source target difference. Source - code written in a way Babel can understand it, target - code that should be in the end as output.
    4. How to configure babel for a specific framework? Each framework like react or angular has its own preset. Preset-react, preset-angular etc.
    5. @babel/runtime - helpers for optimisinig babel work. It helps for example to exclude repeatable code.
______________

 4. ### time complexity space complexity

     **Time complexity**. It calculates amount of time it takes to run an algorithm.
      - **O(1)** - constant. Run time is independent - we don't worry about the input size.

        Examples: accessing an Array Element, REtrieving a Value from object. Retrieving element of array or object takes constant times.
      - **O(n)** - linear time algorithm - execution is proportional to the input size.

      -  **O(n²)**  - quadratic algorithm - number of steps is square root of input size. For example if we have for loop inside another for loop, and these loops're manipuating on the same input.

     **Space complexity** - amount of memory space required to solve some problem/algorithm. Examples:
      - **O(1)** - constant. Run time is independent - we don't worry about the input size.
       ```javascript
          function add(n1, n2) {
            const sum = n1 + n2
            return sum
          }
       ```

      Space complexity is constant. Cause input is constant. We'll always get 2 parameters.


    - **O(n)** - Linear. Space complexity is increasing depending on parameter length.

       
     ```javascript
        function sum(arr) {
          const sum = 0
          for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            sum += arr[i]
          }
          return sum
        }
     ```
      
      It can be also logarithmic O(log n) time complexity or quadratic O(n^2) f.e.

 6. ###  continues-integration
    **Continuous integration** refers to the build and unit testing stages of the software release process ( you can implement it with jenkins for example in your project)

______________

 7. ###  functional-oop-programming
  In OOP, the fundamental basis is classes, instances of which can be stored in variables. In functional programming, however, there are no variables; there are functions and functions only.

______________

 8. ###  dependencies-devdependencies-difference
  Dependencies are crucial for your production build. While Devdependencies are needed only while dev work, but we don't need in production build.

______________

 9. ###  package-json-scripts-typecheck
  When you run npm run typecheck or yarn typecheck, the TypeScript compiler will analyze your TypeScript code and perform type checking based on your type annotations and configuration

______________

 10. ###  extensions-word-package-json
   This option specifies the file extensions that Babel should consider for transpilation

   2. ### picture-sources
      Picture and source are used if we want to add alternative versions of image depending on size of screen for example.

______________
   
   3. ### viewport-what
       The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. The viewport varies with the device.
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> - we  set width of peage  to follow screen-width of the device.
       Initial-scale=1.0 defines zoom defult level.

# GIT, DEPLOYMENT, PIPELINES
 1. ### continuos-deployment
 Continuos deployment - software development practice where code changes are automatically deployed to a production envrionment after passing predefined testing and qualisty assurance stages. It helps to reduce manual intervention and to ensure new code (feats, fixes etc) are delivered to users as quickly as possible. You can configure it in netlify for example.
