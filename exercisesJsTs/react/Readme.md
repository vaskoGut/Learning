1. ### state-toggle
React state updates are asynchronous. If you ever have multiple state updates queued (or the component re-renders before your click is processed), using !good might read a stale value, causing unexpected behavior.
So better choice is:
```javascript
  <button onClick={() => setGood(prevGood => !prevGood)}>change good bad</button>
```

2. ### strict-mode-twice
In React 18+, StrictMode intentionally mounts components twice on purpose in development, to help catch:
Side effects inside components
Impure code in render or state updates
Unexpected behavior with effects
