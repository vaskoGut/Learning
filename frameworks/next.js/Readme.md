1. ### react-next-difference
Next.js is a React framework that adds features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), file-based routing, and API routes out of the box. React alone is just a UI library

***Server site rendering (SSR)*** - Your page is rendered on the server for every request, then sent to the browser as fully-formed HTML.
