1. ### react-next-difference
Next.js is a React framework that adds features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), file-based routing, and API routes out of the box. React alone is just a UI library

***Server site rendering (SSR)*** - Your page is rendered on the server for every request, then sent to the browser as fully-formed HTML.

***SSG*** and when to use it:

***File based routing***:

***api routes out of the box***:
API routes out of the box means Next.js gives you a backend without setting anything up. You just create files and you instantly have APIs.
