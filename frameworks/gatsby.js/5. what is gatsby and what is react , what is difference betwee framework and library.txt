An essential distinction between Gatsby and React is that Gatsby is a
"framework," not a "library." When using a library, you control your application
flow; you call it when you need it. When using a framework, however, there is
an inversion of control. Frameworks command that you adhere to a particular
flow and layout defined by them. Working within a framework can often be
seen as a benefit, as any developer familiar with the framework will know
where to find relevant files and code.
