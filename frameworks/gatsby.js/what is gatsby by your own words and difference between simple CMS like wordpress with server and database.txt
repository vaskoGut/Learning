What is Gatsby?



Gatsby is a free, open source static site generator that harnesses React. Static site
generators are software applications that create static pages from a template or component
and supplement them with content from a source. 

Static site generators are an alternative
to a more traditional database-driven CMS, such as WordPress. In these conventional
systems, content is managed and stored in a database. When the server receives a
particular URL request, the server retrieves data from the database, mixes it with a
template file, and generates an HTML page as its response. Generating HTML on demand
can be a time-consuming process and can leave the user twiddling their thumbs or, worse,
leaving your site.


Gatsby is an open-source framework that combines functionality from React,
 GraphQL and Webpack into a single tool for building static websites and apps
