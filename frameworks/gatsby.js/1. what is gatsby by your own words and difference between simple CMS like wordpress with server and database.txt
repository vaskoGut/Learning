What is Gatsby?



Gatsby is a free, open source static site generator that harnesses React. Static site
generators are software applications that create static pages from a template or component
and supplement them with content from a source. 

Static site generators are an alternative
to a more traditional database-driven CMS, such as WordPress. In these conventional
systems, content is managed and stored in a database. When the server receives a
particular URL request, the server retrieves data from the database, mixes it with a
template file, and generates an HTML page as its response. Generating HTML on demand
can be a time-consuming process and can leave the user twiddling their thumbs or, worse,
leaving your site.


Gatsby is an open-source framework that combines functionality from React,
 GraphQL and Webpack into a single tool for building static websites and apps

 According to their site, “Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps 
 developers build blazing fast websites and apps”. Gatsby allows the developers to make a site using
  React and work with any data source (CMSs, Markdown, etc) of their choice. And then at the build time 
  it pulls the data from these sources and spits out a bunch of static files that are optimized by 
  Gatsby for performance. Gatsby loads only the critical HTML, CSS and JavaScript so that the site 
  loads as fast as possible. Once loaded, Gatsby prefetches resources for other pages so
  clicking around the 
 site feels incredibly fast.
