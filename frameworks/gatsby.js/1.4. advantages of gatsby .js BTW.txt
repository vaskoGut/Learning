Improved performance. Static site generators use the pre-render technique to generate pages in advance.
Flexible customization. While hundreds of pre-built themes and plugins are available, developers can 
create their own from the ground up using their preferred languages and frameworks.
Technological advancements. Modern developer tools, including languages, frameworks, and libraries,
 are some of the reasons behind static site migration. They enable developers to optimize performance 
beyond the traditional web app stack’s limits.
Lighter back-end. Static site generators don’t require an active back-end, as they only use it to source
 data during build time. Also, they don’t need much server-side code as there’s no need to constantly 
query the server for data fetching.
Enhanced security. Static site generators enable developers to use a headless CMS system, separating 
the front-end from the back-end. Therefore, static sites are more secure as they don’t have that many entry points.
