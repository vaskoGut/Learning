Enums allow a developer to define a set of named constants

enum Direction {
  Up,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}

every item in enum has position.

So, for example Direction[0] - it will be 'UP'
Direction[3] - it will be 'Right'


// it can also be difened string enum
enum Direction {
  Up = "UP",
  Down = "DOWN",
  Left = "LEFT",
  Right = "RIGHT",
}

// you can change also defaul order number position, it means

enum Direction {
  Up = 1, 
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}


// now we start from 1, not from 1
