1. What are enums?
Enums allow a developer to define a set of named constants. Using enums can make it easier to document intent, or create a set of distinct cases. TypeScript provides both numeric and string-based enums.

2. what is map type in typescript?
TypeScript map is a new data structure added in ES6 version of JavaScript. It allows us to store data in a key-value pair and remembers the original insertion order 
of the keys similar to other programming languages.
example: 

let map = new Map();  

map.set('1', 'abhishek');     
map.set(1, 'www.javatpoint.com');       
map.set(true, 'bool1');   
map.set('2', 'ajay');  

Map(4) {'1' => 'abhishek', 1 => 'www.javatpoint.com', true => 'bool1', '2' => 'ajay'}
[[Entries]]
0: {"1" => "abhishek"}
1: {1 => "www.javatpoint.com"}
2: {true => "bool1"}
3: {"2" => "ajay"}
size: 4

// get value
map.get('1')
'abhishek'


3. What is boolean method in JS? 
JavaScript provides the Boolean() function that converts other types to a boolean type. 

var b2 = Boolean('h'); // true
var b3 = Boolean(10); // true

4. Renaming destructed variable:
const { isXl: isDesktopType } = screenRecognitionContext;

5. Type aliases and interfaces're  similar, and it can be choosen what you needto use.
 Almost all features of an interface are available in type. 
 The key distinction is that a type cannot be re-opened to add new properties vs an interface which is always extendable.
